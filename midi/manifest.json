All I see is racist faces.\nMisplaced hate makes disgrace to races we under.\nI wonder what it takes to make this one better place...\nlet's erase the wasted.\nTake the evil out the people, they'll be acting right.\n'Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight.\nAnd only time we chill is when we kill each other.\nIt takes skill to be real, time to heal each other.\nAnd although it seems heaven sent,\nwe ain't ready to see a black President, uhh.\nIt ain't a secret don't conceal the fact...\nthe penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks.\nBut some things will never change.\nTry to show another way, but they stayin' in the dope game.\nNow tell me what's a mother to do?\nBein' real don't appeal to the brother in you.\nYou gotta operate the easy way.\n\u0026quot;I made a G today\u0026quot; But you made it in a sleazy way.\nSellin' crack to the kids. \u0026quot;I gotta get paid,\u0026quot;\nWell hey, well that's the way it is.\n\n\n\n\nWe gotta make a change...\nIt's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes.\nLet's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live\nand let's change the way we treat each other.\nYou see the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do\nwhat we gotta do, to survive.\n\nAnd still I see no changes. Can't a brother get a little peace?\nThere's war on the streets and the war in the Middle East.\nInstead of war on poverty,\nthey got a war on drugs so the police can bother me.\nAnd I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do.\nBut now I'm back with the facts givin' 'em back to you.\nDon't let 'em jack you up, back you up, crack you up and pimp smack you up.\nYou gotta learn to hold ya own.\nThey get jealous when they see ya with ya mobile phone.\nBut tell the cops they can't touch this.\nI don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this.\nThat's the sound of my tool. You say it ain't cool, but mama didn't raise no fool.\nAnd as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped and I never get to lay back.\n'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback.\nSome buck that I roughed up way back... comin' back after all these years.\nRat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat. That's the way it is. uhh\n\n\nSome things will never change\n"

What if there's an explanation for this shit?\n(What? She tripped? Fell? Landed on his dick?!)\nAlright Shady, maybe he's right Grady\nBut think about the baby before you get all crazy\n\n\nOkay! Thought about it, still wanna stab her?\nGrab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?\nThat's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard\nYou gonna take advice from somebody who slapped DEE BARNES??!\n\n\nWhat'chu say? (What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?)\nI'ma kill you motherfucker!\n\n\nUhhh-aahh! Temper temper!\nMr. Dre? Mr. N.W.A.?\nMr. AK comin' straight outta Compton y'all better make way?\nHow in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?\n\n\nCause he don't need to go the same route that I went\nBeen there, done that.. aw fuck it...\nWhat am I sayin? Shoot em both Grady, where's your gun at? \n\n\n"

        "Lyrics": "\r\n\nPerhaps I was addicted to the dark side\nSomewhere inside my childhood witnessed  my heart die\nAnd even though we both came from the same places\nThe money and the fame made us all change places\nHow could it be through the misery that came to pass\nThe hard times make a true friend afraid to ask, for currency\nBut you could run to me when you need me, I'll never leave\nI just needed someone to believe in, as you can see\nIt's a small thing through and true\nWhat could I do? Real homies help ya get through,\nAnd coming new, he'd do the same thing if he could\nCause in the hood true homies make you feel good\nAnd half the time we be acting up call the cops\nBringing the cease to the peace that was on my block\nIt never stop, when my mama ask me will I change\nI tell her yeah, but it's clear I'll always be the same\nUntil the end of time\n\n\nSo take, these broken wings\nI need your hands to come and heal me once again\n(Until the end of time)\nSo I can fly away, until the end of time\nUntil the end of time\nUntil the end of time\n\n\nPlease Lord forgive me for my life of sin\nMy hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids\nSo you know I don't hang around the house much\nThis all night money making got me outta touch, shit\nAin't flashed a smile in a long while\nAn unexpected birth worst of the ghetto child\nMy attitude got me walking solo\nRide out alone in my low-low\nWatching the whole world move in slow-mo\nFor quiet times disappear listen to the ocean\nSmoking Ports think my thoughts\nThen it's back to coasting\nWho can I trust in this cold world\nMy phony homey had a baby by my own girl\nBut I ain't tripping I'm a player I ain't sweating him\nI sexed his sister, had her mumbling like a Mexican\nHis next of kin, no remorse it was meant to happen\nBesides rapping the only thing I did good was scrapping\nUntil the end of time\n\n\n\n\nNow who's to say if I was right or wrong?\nTo live my life as an outlaw all along\nRemain strong in this planet full of player haters\nThey conversate but Death Row full of demonstrators\nAnd in the end drinking Hennessy made all my enemies envy me\nSo cold when I flow eliminating easily\nFall to their knees, they plead for their right to breathe\nWhile begging me to keep the peace (ha ha)\nWell I can see close into achieve\nIn times of danger don't freeze time to be a g\nFollow my lead I supply everything you need\nAn ounce of game and the training to make a g\nRemember me, as an outcast outlaw\nAnother album out that's what I'm about, more\nGetting raw till the day I see my casket\nBuried as a g while the whole world remembers me\nUntil the end of time\n\n\n\nIf an angel comes down\nAnd takes me away\nThe memories of me\nAnd my songs\nWill always stay\nTill they can find\n(until the end of time)\nUntil the end of time\nTill the end of time\n"
